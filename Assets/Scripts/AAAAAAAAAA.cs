    RISE AND FALL - Like tetris but both going toward the middle, the bottom player rising and the top one falling
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    FIX:

    TODO:

    Finish treat system.
        Push whatever button to throw treat.
        Collect all of opponents bricks in a list, choose a random item from list, then have chomp go eat that brick.
        
    Balance
        How should scoring work?
            Should there be rounds? or should one win be a win?
            Points for completed lines?
        How fast should pieces fall? How quickly should they get faster?
        Which pieces to use?
        Switch top and bottom every other round?

    Art
        Make better looking pieces, chomper, and UI

    Main Menu, High scores?

    AI for second player?


    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When you complete a line, a cat pac man comes out and chomps the line.

    You can get cat treats for getting multiple lines at once. Throw them on the other player's
        board and Chompy will go eat that tile/tiles.

    The middle row is shared by both players

    Do a four player version?
        Pieces are diagonal
        "Bottom" border is a "V" shape
        four play spaces come together in "X" shape in the center
        Complete a v-shaped line to delete it and move further blocks toward center
