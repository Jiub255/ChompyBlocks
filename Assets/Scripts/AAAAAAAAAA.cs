    RISE AND FALL - Like tetris but both going toward the middle, the bottom player rising and the top one falling
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TODO:
    Fix bottom player's DeleteLine.
        Full lines not getting detected/deleted.
            Probably because CheckLines is only counting the top half for now.


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When you complete a line, a cat pac man comes out and chomps the line.

    You can get cat treats for getting multiple lines at once. Throw them on the other player's
        board and Chompy will go eat that tile/tiles.

    The middle row is shared by both players
