    RISE AND FALL - Like tetris but both going toward the middle, the bottom player rising and the top one falling
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TODO:

    Fix MoveBricksTowardCenter. Only moves one unit towards center instead of however many needed (for multiple lines)

    (Possibly not actually happening)
    Sometimes a block stops moving before it's fully touching another block,
        like when they're only touching at the corner.


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    When you complete a line, a cat pac man comes out and chomps the line.

    You can get cat treats for getting multiple lines at once. Throw them on the other player's
        board and Chompy will go eat that tile/tiles.

    The middle row is shared by both players
