    RISE AND FALL - Like tetris but both going toward the middle, the bottom player rising and the top one falling
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TODO:
    
    Finish chomp lines system.
        Just comment out the actual Destroy part of destroyLines and have the onChomp event run.
        Have chomper go across board back and forth at chompYValues to destroy pieces, then run MoveBricksTowardCenter.

    Finish treat system.
        Push whatever button to throw treat.
        Collect all of opponents bricks in a list, choose a random item from list, then have chomp go eat that brick.
        
    Balance
        How fast should pieces fall? How quickly should they get faster?
        Which pieces to use?
        Switch top and bottom every other round?

    When you complete a line, a cat pac man comes out and chomps the line.

    You can get cat treats for getting multiple lines at once. Throw them on the other player's
        board and Chompy will go eat that tile/tiles.

    The middle row is shared by both players
